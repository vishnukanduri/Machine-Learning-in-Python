# Machine-Learning-in-Python

Here, you will learn about the popular machine learning algorithms with practical examples.

* Distinguish between different types of machine learning tasks, based on examples of how they are applied to real-world problems.

* Understand how k-nearest neighbors learns and makes predictions.

* Build and evaluate a basic k-nearest neighbors classifier on an example dataset using Python and scikit-learn.


* Connection between model complexity and generalization performance.

* The importance of proper feature scaling.

* How to control model complexity by applying techniques like regularization to avoid overfitting. 

* Cross-validation for model evaluation.

* Linear regression (least-squares, ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression), logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees.

* Understand the strengths and weaknesses of particular supervised learning methods in order to apply the right algorithm for a given task.


* Understand why accuracy alone can be an inadequate metric for getting a more complete picture of a classifier's performance.

* Understand the motivation and definition of a variety of important evaluation metrics in machine learning and how to interpret the results of using a given evaluation metric.

* Optimize a machine learning algorithm using a specific evaluation metric appropriate for a given task.


* Ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks.

* Recognize and avoid instances of data leakage
